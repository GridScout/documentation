Welcome to the GridScout troubleshooting guide. Here you'll find comprehensive solutions for common issues, error messages, and configuration problems. Follow our step-by-step instructions to get your bot working smoothly again.

## Common Issues

### Bot Not Responding to Commands

If GridScout isn't responding to your slash commands, check the following:

- **Check permissions**: Ensure GridScout has the necessary permissions in your server:
  - Read Messages/View Channels
  - Send Messages
  - Embed Links
  - Use External Emojis
- **Bot status**: Check if GridScout is online. The bot may be down for maintenance or experiencing outages.
- **Command usage**: Make sure you're using the commands correctly. All commands start with a forward slash (`/`).
- **Discord service**: Check if Discord is experiencing any service issues that might affect bot functionality.

### Incorrect or Outdated Data

If you're seeing outdated or incorrect data:

- **Data refresh timing**: GridScout updates its data as soon as our upstream provider does, which is normally the same day as the race event. Please wait a bit if you're checking immediately after a race.
- **Specific data concerns**: If you believe there's a persistent error in the data (not just timing-related), please report it in our Support Server.
- **F1 data corrections**: Occasionally, official F1 results may be amended after initial publication (e.g., due to penalties). We update our data to reflect these changes as soon as possible.

## Error Messages

Here are solutions for common error messages:

### "I don't have permission to do that"

GridScout needs additional permissions in your server. Ask a server administrator to check the bot's role permissions.

### "This interaction failed"

This typically happens when:

- You're trying to interact with a message that's too old (buttons expire after 15 minutes)
- The bot underwent a routine update or maintenance while you were using it
- There was a temporary connection issue

Try running the command again.

### "Unknown driver/team/circuit"

Check your spelling or try using a more common name/abbreviation through the autocomplete feature.

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Server-Specific Issues

If GridScout works in other servers but not yours:

- Remove and re-invite the bot using the [invitation link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1032988084747063346&permissions=277025704960&scope=bot%20applications.commands)
- Verify your server isn't at the Discord integration limit
